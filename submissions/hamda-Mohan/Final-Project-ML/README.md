# Heart Disease Risk Prediction – ML Model Deployment

**Objective:** Build and deploy a machine learning system that predicts the likelihood of heart disease (low or high risk) based on health indicators and age.

**Tech Stack:** Python (Flask), Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy, React (frontend integration)

**Key Highlights:**
- Trained and compared Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models
- Achieved **99.3% accuracy** with XGBoost as the best-performing model
- Developed REST API using **Flask** for real-time predictions
- Deployed and tested model endpoints (`/register`,`/login`,`/logout`,`/predict`)
- Included dataset, preprocessing scripts, trained models, API code and Frontend
